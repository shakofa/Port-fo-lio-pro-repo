 A student portfolio is a compilation of academic work and other forms of educational evidence assembled for the purpose of  evaluating coursework quality, learning progress, and academic achievement. In this project I used CSS-Bootstrap framework to build a Responsive portfolio website. It includes:

*  A short biography 
*  A contact form 
*  Images
